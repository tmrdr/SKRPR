## Job Skrapr
This application scrapes data from job listing websites and is meant to serve two main functions: to allow users to save jobs that they are interested in, and to simultaneously search multiple jobsites for the keywords entered.

At the moment it is only possible to get jobs from the Seattle area and from Indeed.com but I plan to add an option to select your city and the ability to scrape more than one site in the future.
